# NOTES APP TODO LIST

- [ ] Django and Flask are the most popular tools used to write an application server in Python

- [ ] Create a random directory name? (privacy) or upload it to a vps and call request for access (Hashing)

- [ ] Destroy the labels after shown for a few seconds.

- [ ] Save notes into directory of username.

- [ ] If notes file already exist do not overwrite those notes. 

- [ ] Make it so the user can not resize the UI (Done for login, register, and startup!)

- [ ] Allow the user to enter their username lowercase and it will default to what they originally put. Ex: allowed input: ramonasuncion --> return RamonAsuncion (original)

- [ ] Change the place to where you write text to 'Text' input instead of text variable. 

- [ ] Start working on protecting the password through hashing. 

- [ ] Add image of an eye for password viewer .

- [ ] Do not allow certain characters to become usernames (regex), such at dot files

- [ ] I should not be able to spam the register/login/save button and keep getting the label to show up. 

- [ ] File naming system is shit I need to fix that... Sometimes it says the file_name is not defined??

- [ ] Once I create a new file I need to somehow "refresh" the file system because it cant locate the newly made user... I have to restart the program to do that.

- [ ] Thread to run the sleep command on the text? Make it sleep? And then it disappears. Need to look more into threads. 

- [ ] Setting button to change the color. 

- [ ] Separate class that inherits from tk.Toplevel for TopLevel.

- [ ] Some names are not allowed to be folders because of they being characters. Also, don't allowed periods so they don't become hidden files: .gitignore

- [ ] It's possible to remove the username/password file from the database. It breaks the login button.
